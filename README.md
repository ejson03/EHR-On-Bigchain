# Description

There is a rapid increase in generation of medical data especially in a situation of medical emergency or crisis. When hospitals are understaffed to maintain healthcare data, they are prone to be tampered with. Users do not recieve their medical information on time and cannot approach other institutions quickly with their medical history.

* Solution: Bring EHR to blockchain

BigchainDB is a decentralized database that has immutability just like traditional blockchains. We have attempted to develop an end to end system for succesful storage, transfer and tracking of patient healthcare data. All records are encrypted using AES-256 encryption and the access for this data is transferred through blockchain and assymetric cryptography. Due to limited blockchain data storage, files are being stored in IPFS.
